# 2021-02-24 Challenge - Week 4

## Balloon

### Today's JavaScript Challenge is from [Chapter 15: Handling Events](https://eloquentjavascript.net/15_event.html).

[Exercise on Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/15_event.html#h_TcUD2vzyMe) | [Try to solve it on jsbin](https://jsbin.com/debisazafu/edit?html,js,output) | [Link to main GitHub repo](https://github.com/codejourneys-org/wednesday-javascript-challenge)

Write a page that displays a balloon (using the balloon emoji, ðŸŽˆ). When you press the up arrow, it should inflate (grow) 10 percent, and when you press the down arrow, it should deflate (shrink) 10 percent.

You can control the size of text (emoji are text) by setting the font-size CSS property (style.fontSize) on its parent element. Remember to include a unit in the valueâ€”for example, pixels (10px).

The key names of the arrow keys are "ArrowUp" and "ArrowDown". Make sure the keys change only the balloon, without scrolling the page.

When that works, add a feature where, if you blow up the balloon past a certain size, it explodes. In this case, exploding means that it is replaced with an ðŸ’¥ emoji, and the event handler is removed (so that you canâ€™t inflate or deflate the explosion).

### Share
