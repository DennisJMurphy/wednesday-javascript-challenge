# Wednesday JavaScript Challenge

Every Wednesday in February 2021 we will share a JavaScript Challenge. <br />
The challenges are from the book "[Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/)" by Marijn Haverbeke.

We encourage you to **code along and share your knowledge**!

## Challenges

- [Week 1 - 2021-02-03](./challenges/2021-02-03/README.md)
- [Week 2 - 2021-02-10](./challenges/2021-02-10/README.md)
- [Week 3 - 2021-02-17](./challenges/2021-02-17/README.md)
- [Week 4 - 2021-02-24](./challenges/2021-02-24/README.md)

## :star: Share

You can partecipate here on GitHub [adding your solution to any "challenge"](./challenges/how-to.md), or creating a new [JsBin](https://jsbin.com/?html,output) and sharing it in [our Slack channel](https://codejourneys.org/join-us/).

Or simply share in a code block, in a [Tweet](https://codejourneys.org), in an e-mail :) Write it however you prefer!

## :pray: Need help?

Post questions in our Slack Channel and we can try and find solutions together.

But please try and find the answers on your own first :)

## :calendar: Deadline

We will post the solutions in Slack every Thursday to give everyone time to work on it.

Feel free to share your solution or questions before then!

Good luck and please shout if you need help! :dancer: :tada:
